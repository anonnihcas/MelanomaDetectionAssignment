## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

 
## Conclusions
1. Training with transformation, including more samples and with more epochs resulted in removing overfitting.

2. Model training without normalization has improved Training and Testing accuracy. However, training with 50 epochs training time has increased.

3. Batch Normalization improves accuracy, but does not improve overfitting.
